# CeaserCipher
C# implementation of a Ceaser cipher

You can use this app to encode and decode messages using a ceaser cipher.

You can also input ciphert text that has been encoded with an unknown key, and the program will attempt to crack it.
This program uses a brute force approach, so this process can take a couple seconds.

To back out of a menu, enter 'q' when prompted for 'plaintext' or 'ciphertext'

binaries and stuff are checked in at the moment, because I haven't added a .gitignore yet.
